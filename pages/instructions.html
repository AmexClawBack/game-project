            <ol>
            <li>To start the game, click "Embrace your fate"</li>
            <li>A 20 sided polyhedron will be rolled for both players, determining who attacks first</li>
            <li>Once the game commences the computer will attack automatically when it is its turn, and you must press "attack" in order to enter offensive combat.</li>
            <li>Each "creature" has "attack" and "defense". When a creature attacks using its "attack power", the opposing creature automatically blocks using its "defense power" stat. If the attacking creatures attack power is more than the defending creatures defense power, then the defending creature will be sent to the graveyard and the remaining attack power will reduce the players health by that much.</li>
            <li>If a creature is sent to the graveyard, the player must CLICK on the next card to flip and play a new creature card.</li>
            <li>To win you must drop the enemies health to 0, if not you lose.</li>
