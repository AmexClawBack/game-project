 To start the game, click "Embrace your fate"
            Each player starts with 20 health.
            To begin, you must click the attack button
            Each time the attack button is clicked, a random enemy card and a random player card will be chosen and they will battle.
            Each card has their own attack and defense stats. The remainder of each attack will do that amount of damage to the opposing players health. 
            
            Your cards attack power - enemy defense = the amount of health the enemy loses.
            Enemy cards attack power - your defense = the amount of health you lose
            The player whose health reaches 0 first loses.
